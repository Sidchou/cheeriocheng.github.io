Intricate natural forms emerge from simple logic. Small change in the logic results in incredible variations. Snowflakes, tree branches, seashells, these are all fascinating natural formation with infinite possibilities.

I created a series of 'airshells', shells that mimic the logic of seashell formation, for Tilandsia, or air plants. You can make your own using this webpage: cheeriocheng.github.io
